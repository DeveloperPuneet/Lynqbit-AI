# Lynqbit AI

Lynqbit AI is an advanced AI framework built for experimentation, learning, and production-grade projects.  
It provides tools, prompts, and datasets designed to optimize AI workflows — from fine-tuning to deployment.

---

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ Easy integration with AI/ML projects  
- 📚 Support for structured datasets (Q&A, instructions, knowledge bases)  
- 🧠 Prompt engineering utilities for LLMs  
- 🛠️ Ready-to-use templates (e.g., MongoDB inserts, AI behaviors)  
- 🔒 Secure, open-source foundation for collaborative AI research

## ⚠️ Important Note
This project is currently trained only on a **4k question-answer dataset**.  
As a result, the AI may sometimes produce **irrelevant or incomplete responses**.  
It should be used mainly for **experimentation, research, and learning purposes**, not as a production-ready model.  

Contributions to improve training data, evaluation, and reliability are **highly encouraged** 🚀

## 📚 Adding New Data

We welcome contributions to expand the training dataset! 🎉  

If you want to add new question–answer pairs:  

1. Go to the `data/` folder.  
2. Open (or create) a file in **JSON format** like this:  
   ```json
   [
     {
       "question": "What is MongoDB?",
       "answer": "MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents."
     },
     {
       "question": "How to insert a document in MongoDB?",
       "answer": "Use `db.collection.insertOne({ ... })` to insert a single document."
     }
   ]
   ```
Make sure your file follows the same structure.

Add at least 10–20 high-quality Q&A pairs per contribution.

Run tests to ensure JSON is valid (e.g., using jsonlint
).

Submit a pull request (PR) with a short description of your dataset addition.

⚠️ Please keep questions and answers clear, factual, and relevant to AI/ML, programming, or knowledge base topics.
